### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
#  The equals operator should be written as ==.  Here the assignment = operator has been incorrectly used instead.  A colon is reqired after the else statement.  






  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2

  # The function should start with word def not dif.  There should be a comma between card1 and card2 arguments.  The if statement needs to be indented.
  # The first return should say card1.  Both return statements and the else statement need to be indented.  
  
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
# Total should start at 0 so it should be writen as total = 0
  
  
```
